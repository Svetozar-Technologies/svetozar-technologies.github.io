  },
  "faq_items": {
    "q1": {
      "question": "How can this be completely free?",
      "answer": "LocalMind runs entirely on your device, so we have zero cloud infrastructure costs. No servers to maintain, no bandwidth to pay for, no storage fees. We believe AI should be accessible to everyone, so we've built a truly free solution that doesn't rely on the \"freemium\" model. Our code is open source - if you don't trust us, you can audit and compile it yourself."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Is it really as accurate as cloud services?",
      "answer": "Yes! LocalMind uses OpenAI's Whisper model - the same technology behind many commercial transcription services. We achieve 95%+ accuracy across 99 languages. Plus, our Chain-of-Thought quality scoring provides 20-30% better analysis accuracy than standard approaches. The only difference is your data stays on your device."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Will this work without an internet connection?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! After the initial model download (one-time, happens on first run), LocalMind works 100% offline. Process audio files on airplanes, in remote locations, or anywhere without internet. Your workflow is never interrupted by connectivity issues."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I use this commercially?",
      "answer": "Yes! LocalMind is licensed under MIT - one of the most permissive open source licenses. Use it for personal projects, client work, commercial products, or anything else. No attribution required (though always appreciated). The only restriction: you can't hold us liable if something goes wrong."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What about subtitle/SRT export for videos?",
